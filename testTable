Test1: default values given

Test2: to see how well the couriers would distribute Jobs with an equal number of studebts
	all jobs were almost evenly distributed between couriers
	with a courier picking up a job almost as soon as one was
	created.  No Watecard was lost in this test.  
	Note: numStudents = numCouriers, however some students finished
	early (S1, S4), meaning there were spare couriers to pick up
	any outstanding job

Test3: to see how well a single courier could deal with multiple students (10 in this case)
	due to the large load of jobs, all the students ended up using their giftcard first
	since the courrier was regularly interupted while trying to complete a job. The 
	courier also lost a lot more WATCards (~9).  This is to be expected though since
	the  number of lost WATCards increases with the number of jobs
	the courier takes.  Since the total number of drinks students needed to drink
	was 42, the courier had at least 32 jobs. One sixth of 32 is approximately 5,
	meaning the courier would have bben expected to lose at least 5 WATCards, with a 
	possibility of losing them again. therefore ~9 losses isn't a surprise.
	Overall, the courier performed as expected.

Test4: to test a case where no groupoff is used
	due to the large delay, small number of students and the fact that each student only
	needed to drink 1 soda, no student used the giftcard.  it simply took too long to
	deliver the giftcards. Groupoff only delivered 2 out 5 gift cards before it's 
	destructor was called.  Although it delivered the second giftcard after all the students 
	had finished, the program still ended without a problem and it didn't take long to complete

Test5 to test the affect of a long Parental delay on purchases
	As expected, the program took longer than any other time to completeand printed almost 5500
	lines.  since the parents only deposited between $[1,3] at a time and the soda cost was $5
	the students were required to wait much longer for Parents to deposit enough funds to their
	accounts.  Something to note about couriers: in this test, there was a case where Courier0 
	lost a student's card and Courier4 took the job to transfer funds to the new card after the 
	student requested a new card from WATCardOffice (by calling create).
